# About the project

As the name implies, Introduction to Open Data Science (IODS) is an introductory data science course at the University of Helsinki. The purpose of the course is to introduce the students to use of open research tools and open data, state of the art of data science tools *RStudio**, **Rmarkdown** and __GitHub__, and last, teach multivariate statistical methods and data visualization.  Personally, the main focus of my research is time series analysis of magnetically active stars, therefore my statistics toolbox consists mostly of *single variable methods*. I have also mainly used Python for my programming and data analysis needs, and for these two reasons alone I am quite excited about the course and hoping that the skills I will learn here will be inspirational and provide new possibilities for my own research.  The repository for the personal course work can be found [here](https://github.com/PerttuKajatkari/IODS-project).

There could be code here. But there's not.

As a warmup, here is some random RMarkdown stuff

It seems LaTex syntax works here, which is nice: $e^{i\pi}=-1$.
